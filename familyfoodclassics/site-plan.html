      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        There are many websites that you can find with recipes that are really hit or miss as far as quality, health, and cost are concerned. With the consistently high rate of inflation resulting cost of living going ever higher it can be very hard to keep a healthy meal plan going. Healthy should be understood as both the physical well-being of a person due to a healthy diet, but also the financial health that is increasingly difficult to maintain. Many people think that healthy, tasty, and cheap are nearly impossible to get all on the same plate but I want to prove that premise wrong. </p>
      <p>On the home page, I will be creating a simple Bio of myself, my food, and why it matters to me so much. You do not need to be some fancy chef to make food that will blow people away and I am a perfect example of that. Through simple initiative and a little trial and error, I have been able to create food that has wowed many mouths. I want to highlight other values brought to your life by incorporating the habit of making home-cooked meals for yourself or those nearest to you. So much has been lost in people's lives by letting the mirage of convenience pull you towards eating out or heating up a frozen dinner. At a fundamental level our civilizations and lives revolve around the time we spend eating and who we spend it with and it is something that is not worth wasting.

      </ul>
      <h3>Budgeting</h3>
      <p>
      I want to lay out the basic principles of eating healthy on a budget and tracking your costs on a weekly and monthly basis. I will include a link to an excel spreadsheet that can be used for creating that budget. There are very simple ways to better maintain a consistent budget for food and not feel like you have to live like you are completely broke. I want this to be inspirational and help open people's minds to the ways that they can really make an impact on their bottom dollar.

      </ul>
      <h3>Recipes</h3>
      <p>
      For the time being, I will create a page for the top 2 favorite recipes for my family and include instructions as well as tips for making sure it ends up prepared correctly (This will become a searchable index eventually and include many other recipes but for this initial draft I do not want to over complicate things and end up with something non-functional). I am focusing on the quality of recipes over quantity and only will include those that I know will bring smiles to faces and help bring peace to financially stressful times. If an ingredient is potentially difficult to come by I will include some alternatives listed in the recipe itself and any differences in how to use them compared to the original ingredient.
